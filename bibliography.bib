abstract = {Stress-controlled thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) behavior of IN 718 superalloy with different concentrations of boron (B) and carbon (C) was studied with temperature varying between 350 and 650 °C at different cyclic stress ranges and at a stress ratio of R = 0.1. Initial cyclic softening followed by a significant cyclic hardening was observed in the in-phase (IP) TMF, while continuous cyclic hardening occurred during out-of-phase (OP) TMF. Tensile cyclic creep was observed in all the TMF deformation regimes, and the creep strain increased with increasing number of cycles and stress range. B and C additions were found to retard the cyclic creep, leading to an effective improvement in the fatigue life of IP-TMF. Among the four alloys tested, the alloy with 29 ppm B and 225 ppm C exhibited the lowest creep strain and the highest IP-TMF life at the lower stress range. In the OP-TMF, the fatigue life increased with increasing B concentration at the higher stress range, and with C concentration at the lower stress range. The IP-TMF life was observed to be much shorter than that of the OP-TMF, with a crossover occurring at the higher stress range. Fractographic examinations showed that the fracture was predominantly intergranular in the IP-TMF mode, and transgranular, as characterized by typical fatigue striations, in the OP-TMF mode of deformation. The difference in the fracture mechanisms between the IP and OP-TMF mode of deformation was the primary reason for a significant influence of the loading mode on the TMF lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An experimental test facility was developed to perform thermo-mechanical fatigue crack growth experiments. The thermal cycles were generated using hot and cold air flows distributed by a nozzle onto the test specimen. With the equipment it was possible to obtain TMF cycles with cycle times of 120 s with less than 10 °C temperature variation over the measurement length of the sample, cycling between 200 °C and 550 °C. The equipment allows TMF crack propagation tests up to, at least, 600 °C. The crack length and the crack closure level were determined using the potential drop technique. Thermo-mechanical fatigue crack propagation experiments were performed in-phase and out-of-phase with various R-values on samples of Inconel 718. Cylindrical specimens with a small starter crack were cycled in nominal total strain control. The crack propagation rate was determined and the correlation to the effective J-integral range, $\Delta$Jeff, corrected for crack closure presented. The fracture surfaces showed a dominance of trans-granular crack propagation with striations, indicating a low degree of time dependency in the procedure. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Low-cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of nickel-based precipitation -strengthened superalloy GH4145/SQ was investigated systematically under fully reversed total strain amplitude control conditions at 538 ??C in laboratory air. It was shown that the alloy exhibited a pronounced initial fatigue hardening followed by continuous fatigue softening to failure at high strain amplitudes, while at low strain amplitudes the initial hardening was followed by a well-defined saturation stage. Microstructure observations using optical and transmission-electron microscopy revealed that slip band density increased with increasing total strain amplitudes and the size of the ?????precipitates tended to reduction due to repeated shearing by the dislocations with continuous cyclic straining. The above changes in microstructures during cycling were essentially responsible for the fatigue hardening-softening behavior of the alloy. Both optical and SEM micrographs indicated that at low strain amplitudes crack propagation was basically transgranular, while at high strain amplitudes crack propagation was essentially intergranular. Bilinear behavior with a change of slope at a plastic strain amplitude of about 0.2 pct was observed in cyclic stress-strain (CSS), Coffin-Manson (C-M) and plastic strain energy-life plots. A change in the number of operating slip systems and the fracture modes with the strain amplitude employed was used to explain this two-slope characteristic. In both the companion specimens test (CST) and the incremental step test (IST) methods the alloy exhibited non-masing type behavior. It was suggested that, for the first approximation, the half-life plastic strain energy could be calculated directly according to the equation without reckoning in the non-masing behavior. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Various hold times were introduced at the peak tensile strain to investigate the high-temperature creep-fatigue interaction (CFI) effects under the same temperature. A substantial decrease in fatigue life occurred as the total strain amplitude increased. Moreover, tensile strain holding further reduced fatigue life. The saturation phenomenon of holding effect was found when the holding period reached 120. s. Cyclic softening occurred during the LCF and CFI process and it was related to the total strain amplitude and the holding period. The relationship between life-time and total strain amplitude was obtained by combining Basquin equation and Coffin-Manson equation.

Fatigue life of the salt coated specimens was found to be drastically reduced at all the total strain amplitudes. In general there was cyclic softening both in the bare as well as salt coated specimens. Variation of fatigue life with plastic strain amplitude followed Coffin-Manson relationship. Reduction in fatigue life from salt coating was found to be associated with early crack initiation from the roots of corrosion pits on the surface and faster crack propagation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

At these temperatures also the uniaxial and biaxial-planar isothermal material behavior was studied. In order to determine the influence of the multiaxial stress state on the fatigue life biaxial-planar isothermal tests were carried out at three different strain ratios. The uniaxial isothermal lifetimes coincide very well with literature data. A conservative lifetime description for thermo-mechanical in-phase and out-of-phase fatigue test was set based on the isothermal tests at the upper temperature. The comparison of lifetimes from uniaxial and biaxial-planar tests shows that the equivalent strain hypothesis according to von Mises correlates the fatigue lives of the different stress states within a scatter band of two. The failure mechanism including crack initiation, crack growth and the macroscopic crack path were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A change from a mainly transgranular crack growth at 673 K to a mostly intergranular fracture at 923 K as well as under thermo-mechanical fatigue loading was found. The fatigue lives of the isothermal and thermo-mechanical tests under both uniaxial and biaxial-planar loading were correlated by a new lifetime model which is based on a stress¨Cstrain approach. "

abstract = {Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) tests with loading conditions involving a combined thermal and mechanical strain cycle were carried out on a third generation ??-TiAl alloy with fine duplex microstructure. The experiments were conducted at a total strain amplitude of 0.6{\%} in out-of-phase (OP) and in-phase (IP) modes. The temperature range was kept constant at 250 ??C and the maximum temperatures applied were 700, 750 and 800 ??C. The TMF results revealed that thermomechanical loading conditions must be considered as very crucial for the design of components made of ??-TiAl alloys. In particular, out-of-phase loading conditions reduce fatigue life tremendously as compared to the corresponding isothermal conditions. The very short out-of-phase loading life can be attributed to an accelerated oxidation-induced crack initiation during tension in the low-temperature part of the TMF cycle and is a consequence of the formation of an embrittled zone at the surface during the high-temperature part of the loading cycle. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The basis for the life prediction is the stress-strain response of the material for one selected cycle obtained in the context of a Finite Element Analysis. Here the application of an appropriate inelastic constitutive model is essential. A phenomenological fatigue model is proposed which is able to describe mean-stress effects, as well as dependencies on hold time and cycle duration with reasonable accuracy. The model performance is compared with that of a mechanism based literature model. The model accuracy is evaluated on a statistical basis through an evaluation of the variance in the ratio between predicted life and actual life.},

The effects of cyclic stress amplitude, mean stress, and their histories on the ratcheting were experimentally investigated under uniaxial and different multiaxial loading paths. The shapes of non-proportional loading paths were linear, circular, elliptical and rhombic, respectively. In the constitutive model, the rate-dependent behavior of the material was reflected by a viscous term; the cyclic flow and cyclic hardening behaviors of the material under asymmetrical stress-controlled cycling were reflected by the evolution rules of kinematic hardening back stress and isotropic deforming resistance, respectively. The effect of loading history on the ratcheting was also considered by introducing two fading memorization functions for maximum inelastic strain amplitude and isotropic deformation resistance, respectively, into the constitutive model. The effect of multiaxial loading path on the ratcheting was reflected by a non-proportional factor defined in this work. The predicting ability of the developed model was proved to be good by comparing the simulations with corresponding experiments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A path-independent multiaxial fatigue damage criterion is proposed based on critical plane concepts: fatigue crack growth is controlled by the maximum shear strain, and an important secondary effect is due to the normal strain excursion over one reversal of the maximum shear strain. The effect of loading path on fatigue endurance is quantified by the normal strain excursion. Only one multiaxial material constant is required in the model which can be determined from uniaxial test data plus one torsional result. The parameter can be easily integrated with a shear strain-life relationship to predict low cycle fatigue lifetime. Experimental data of four different materials: En1 5R steel, I{\%} Cr-Mo-V steel, 304 stainless steel, and 316 stainless steel at two temperatures were used to verify the criterion. It is shown that the proposed parameter can satisfactorily correlate test results for various proportional and non-proportional straining paths.},

abstract = {A new theory for multiaxial fatigue is presented that is based on a physical interpretation of the mechanisms of fatigue crack growth. It may be represented graphically by contours of constant life, which are expressed mathematically by¡Ê13-¡Ê32=f[¡Ê1+¡Ê32]where ¡Ê1, ¡Ê2 and ¡Ê3 are the principal strains, ¡Ê1, ¡Ý ¡Ê2 ¡Ý ¡Ê3This equation underlines the importance of strain parameters in correlating fatigue data. It illustrates the effect of both the shear strain and the tensile strain normal to the plane of maximum shear.The theory is compared with several classical and recent theories, which are briefly reviewed. It is shown that classical theories of fatigue failure cannot correlate experimental data, and may be dangerous if used for design purposes.Table 1. caption: Stress¨Cstrain states for multiaxial systemsTable 2. caption: Values of shear strain in terms of uniaxial shear strain ($\gamma$u) for same crack growth rate (n = 0.2)Fig. 1. caption: Mohr's circle of strainFig. 2. caption: Classical failure criteria on the §¤©\planeFig. 3. caption: Classical failure criteria on the plane of principal stressesFig. 4. caption: Planes of maximum shear and crack growth directionFig. 5. caption: §¤©\plane. 1{\%} Cr¨CMo¨CV steel (Liddle and Miller)Fig. 6. caption: §¤©\plane.

abstract = {This study investigates torsional deformation and fatigue behavior of both solid and thin-walled tube specimens made of a high strength quenched and tempered spring steel. Uniaxial deformation and fatigue data of this steel were already available. Monotonic and cyclic deformation curves are predicted from the von Mises and Tresca criteria and compared to the torsional data. Three types of torsional fatigue tests involving shear mean stress as well as tensile and compressive mean stresses were also performed in order to gain a better understanding as to how to predict the behavior of the material under such loading. The stress-life (S-N) approach and strain-life curve based on commonly used failure criteria are evaluated. Failure modes and fracture surfaces were observed and are discussed with regards to the failure criteria commonly used for life predictions. The differences in cyclic deformation and fatigue behaviors between solid round specimens where a stress gradient exists, and thin-walled tube specimens where a uniform stress state is commonly assumed, are also discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
