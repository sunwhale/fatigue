\begin{abstract}

Turbine components are generally under mechanical and thermal loads. Recent works confirm significant effects of thermomechanical loads to fatigue life assessment. In the present work, extensive experiments are performed for a nickel-based superalloy under both iso-thermal and thermo-mechanical loading conditions to quantify influence of thermal phase angle and loading non-proportionality. Based on experimental data a thermomechanical loading parameter is introduced to assess fatigue failure. The thermomechanical fatigue life can be calibrated based on the present concept reasonably.

\section{Introduction}
Gas turbine components experience severe cyclic multi-axial mechanical loadings and thermal loadings. The increasing operating temperature in gas turbines is pushing materials closer to their operating limits. Quantifying mechanical behavior and fatigue performance of the components under the more realistic conditions becomes necessary \cite{Harrison1996}.

In the past decades the high temperature superalloy In718 was extensively tested under isothermal loading conditions, especially by different aero engine manufacturers. Engineering design is based on uniaxial data, so that the influence of the loading multi-axiality was not clarified. In literature very few systematic experimental data can be found. For engineering applications numerous investigations on the isothermal low cycle fatigue of the nickel-based superalloy were performed \cite{Mahobia2014, Chen2016, William1995}\marked{(Add two handbooks here)}. Additional series of strain controlled fatigue tests at $649^\circ$C was been completed by Kim \cite{kim1988elevated} and Nelson \cite{nelson1992creep} from NASA with strain rate from $2\times10^{-4}$s$^{-1}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$s$^{-1}$.
 \marked{(Overview on isothermal fatigue is too short. More publications on IN718, incl. Socie \& Co. should be mentioned. Our MTU report contains data from them in 1989)}. Life design of the turbine components is based on isothermal results, although the real loading history in turbine is essentially under varying temperature. One believes that the material fatigue under higher temperature is more critical than that under thermomechanical condition with both varying mechanical and thermal loads. From engineering application view point, fatigue life prediction of isothermal components is more feasible than the thermomechanical life design. However, experiments reveal that the varying temperature changes fatigue damage mechanisms and may accelerate material failure significantly. Recently quantifying thermomechanical fatigue damage becomes an important design issue, especially for high performance turbines.

Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) means fatigue under both cyclic mechanical loads as well as cyclic temperature. The study of Sehitoglu \marked{(In this paragraph more literature and results on TMF are necessary.)} showed that material experiences different damage processes under TMF and fatigue life is sensitive to the loading configuration. In past years many TMF tests were published mainly for uniaxial loading cases \cite{Evans2008, Kulawinski2015, Remy2003, Bauer2009}. The major issue was to demonstrate effects of the loading phase angles and to correlate fatigue life with the phase angle. A phenomenological fatigue models was proposed  in \cite{Vose2013} to predict the material fatigue life under isothermal and thermo-mechanical loading conditions. However, these works are limited to the uniaxial loading condition. It is well known the deformation and damage mechanisms under multiaxial loads can significantly differ from those under uniaxial loading \cite{Fang2015, Kang2004, Chen2004}. Most components in turbine engines typically experience significant variations in multiaxial states of stress, strain and temperatures under non-isothermal conditions. There are few works on the multiaxial TMF fatigue life published \cite{Brookes2010}.

The present paper considers thermomechanical fatigue under tension-torsion loading conditions and discusses multiaxial TMF fatigue. Both elastic-plastic behavior and fatigue life under multiaxial TMF loading condition are investigated. It is shown that the TMF affects fatigue performance of the material significantly.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Material specification}
% Inconel 718 is one of the most popular nickel-based superalloys used in turbine engines. The material possesses optimal property at both room temperature as well as at elevated temperature and does not reveal obvious creep up to $650^\circ$C. 
The investigated material is the nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718, which was provided by Thyssen Krupp VDM GmbH, in the form of rods of 20mm diameter.
The rods were solution treated at 980$^{\circ}$C for one and a half hour then cooled to room temperature by water.
Then they were aged for eight hours at 720$^{\circ}$C, furnace cooled at 56$^{\circ}$C/h to 621$^{\circ}$C, where they were held for eight hours and forced air cooling to room temperature.
The chemical composition of the nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 in the investigation is given in Table \ref{Tab:ChemicalCompositionofIN718}.

Optical microscopy has been used to observe the metallurgical structure of the material. After polishing, the sample was electrolytically etched with oxalic acid. Fig. \ref{Fig:microstructure_200X} shows the initial microstructure of the material. According to the linear intercept method, the average diameter of the initial grains is about 20 $\rm{\mu }$m.

\subsection{Specimens}
The thin-walled tubular specimen, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:Specimen}, was used in the present work. The specimen dimension is in accordance with ASTM E2207 \cite{ASTM2014} and matches the extensometer, the furnace and the induction coil. The experiments confirm that the specimen geometry influences the temperature distribution. Consequently the final geometry is determined by computational experiments and temperature measurement for optimal experiments.

The shape of the induction coil influences the temperature distribution in the specimen. Induction heating efficiency is dependent on the coil density and the distance between the coil and specimen surface. A concentrated coil density and a short distance to the specimen surface results in high heat flux. The coil has to be optimized for an optimal smooth axial temperature distribution in both heating and cooling processes. Temperature is measured with a thermocouple (type K) installed with compression junctions to the specimen. The final axial temperature deviations within the gauge length 12mm are below $\pm5^\circ$C by total $650^\circ$C and within the gauge length 25mm are less than $\pm14^\circ$C, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:Temp-Distr}.

Experiments were conducted on an MTS tension-torsion closed-loop servo hydraulic testing machine. Cooling is achieved by enforced air convection and heating is achieved by the induction heating device. The system is capable of applying both axial and biaxial loads with the temperature variation simultaneously. Thus, uniaxial or biaxial stress state can be generated under a given certain temperature range in the specimen. Also the test requirements from ASTM standard E2368 \cite{ASTM2014a} should be considered. Fig. \ref{Fig:Equipments} shows the induction heating system. The strains were measured using the high temperature axial and biaxial extensometers which contact the specimen surface with two ceramic rods. The gauge length of the axial-torsional extensometers is 25mm.

\subsection{Fatigue tests}
According to the standard ASTM E2368 \cite{ASTM2014a}, a thermomechanical fatigue cycle requests uniform temperature and strain fields over the specimen gage section which vary simultaneously and independently under given loading conditions. In the present work several factors may influence experimental results and the definitions are given as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Thermal strain}, $\varepsilon_{th}$, is induced by temperature and assumed to be linear proportional to temperature increment, $\varepsilon_{th}=\alpha \Delta T$. The thermal strain is generally isotropic.
  \item {\em Mechanical strain}, $\varepsilon_{m}$, is resulting from applied load and directly related with material deformation and damage. Under tension-torsion loading conditions, the mechanical deformation in testing is characterized by the maximum principal strain.
  \item {\em Total strain}, $\varepsilon_t$, is measured by the extensometer and denotes the sum of the thermal and mechanical strains, $\varepsilon_t=\varepsilon_m+\varepsilon_{th}$. Since the fatigue loading amplitudes are generally small, strains are additive.
  \item {\em Loading ratio}, $R_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon_{m,\min}/\varepsilon_{m,\max}$, denotes the ratio of the minimum mechanical strain over the maximum mechanical strain within a loading cycle. Under axial-torsional loading condition, the mechanical strains are the principal strains.
  \item {\em Phase angle of the thermal loading and mechanical loading}, $\theta_{T-\varepsilon}$, represents the time difference between maximum values of temperature and mechanical strain. %For multi-axial cases the phase angle is oriented to the principal strain.
  \item {\em Phase angle of the thermal loading and torsinal loading}, $\theta_{T-\gamma}$, represents the time difference between maximum values of temperature and shear strain.
  \item {\em Phase angle of the mechanical loading and torsinal loading}, $\theta_{\varepsilon-\gamma}$, represents the time difference between maximum values of mechanical strain and shear strain.
  \item {\em Equivalent mechanical strain}, $\varepsilon_{eq}=\sqrt {\varepsilon _m^2 + {\gamma ^2}/3}$, is calculated by the von Mises relation\cite{Pol1991Cyclic}.
\end{itemize}

All fatigue tests were performed in the temperature interval from 300$^\circ$C to 650$^\circ$C under mechanical strain control with fully reversed mechanical strain loading $R_{\varepsilon}=-1$. The isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue test matrix consisted of: tension-compression isothermal (TC-IF), tension-compression in-phase (TC-IP), tension-compression out-of-phase (TC-OP), tension-compression 90$^\circ$ phase (TC-90), proportional in-phase (PRO-IP) and non-proportional in-phase (NPR-IP) tests. The experimental conditions of isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue tests are summarized in Table \ref{Tab:TestMatrix} with respect to testing parameters such as test type, mechanical and torsional strain amplitudes, equivalent strain amplitude and rates as well as phase shifts between mechanical strain, shear strain and temperature. All tests were carried out in air. 

Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath} shows schematically three strain paths for uniaxial tension/compression (Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(a)), proportional (Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(b)), and non-proportional (Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(c)) tests. Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(b) represents a 45$^\circ$ proportional loading with the ratio $\varepsilon_{m}/(\gamma/\sqrt{3})=1$. While Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(c) shows a diamond non-proportional strain path (i.e. the ratio of mechanical strain amplitude and shear strain amplitude is 1). Loading ratio $R_\varepsilon$ means the ratio of minimum mechanical strain to the maximum mechanical strain in a loading cycle. Under the axial-torsional condition, the loading ratio is calculated from the principal strains. 

It should be noted that the thin-walled tubular specimen is used in this study. In the tubular specimen, the shear strain and shear stress are not constant in the cross-section, and the shear stress and shear strain are always the greatest at the outer diameter. Under elasto-plastic loading conditions, shear stress varies nonlinearly through the thin wall of the tubular specimen. Therefore, according to ASTM E2207 \cite{ASTM2014}, the assumption of a uniformly distributed shear stress is recommended. The shear stresses reported in this study are calculated dependent on the assumption as:
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{16T}{\pi(d_o^2-d_i^2)(d_o+d_i)},
\end{equation}
where, $T$ is the torsional moment, $\tau$ is the shear stress, $d_o$ and $d_i$ are the outer and inner diameters of the thin-walled hollow specimen, respectively. The effect of temperature variation on shear strain measurement can be neglected, according to Ref. \cite{Bakis2014}. Consequently, the compensation of torsional thermal strain is not performed in the present work. The shear strains are obtained directly from the measurement results by the extensometer.
%$N_f$ was defined as number of cycles at failure, i.e. $N_f$ represents the last cycle.$N_f$

%The multi-axial fatigue tests ran under given axial strain $\varepsilon$ and shear strain $\gamma$ in a cycle. The proportional and the non-proportional loading paths are shown in Figures \ref{Fig:LoadPath}. While Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath} (b) shows a proportional load,  Figs. \ref{Fig:LoadPath} (c) and (d) define two non-proportional loads, with very different characteristics. Loading ratio $R_\varepsilon$ means the ratio of minimum mechanical strain to the maximum mechanical strain in a loading cycle. Under the tension-torsion condition, the loading ratio is calculated from the principal strains.

In comparison with isothermal fatigue test, the thermomechanical fatigue test is carried out under varying temperature. Throughout the duration of the test, the temperatures were measured with three chromel-alumel (type K) thermocouples wrapped around the specimen. Fig. \ref{Fig:Temp-Distr} shows the thermal stability during the TMF tests. The middle temperature was used as a control parameter. In order to avoid considerable axial and radial temperature gradients within the strain gauge of the specimen, in this work, the heating and cooling rates were chosen about 2.92$^\circ$C/s with a triangular shape tempetarue cycle, thus the time of one cycle is about 240s, and the frequency is about 0.0042Hz.

% , as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:Temp-Distr}, in which the thermomechanical loads are characterized additionally by the phase angle, $\varphi$. 
% In the present work, the temperature cycled from $T_{min}=300^\circ$C to $T_{max}=650^\circ$C at a heating/cooling rates of 3.89K/s with the constant ramp rates forming a triangular cycle. 
% The test matrix for the present work is summarized in Table \ref{Tab:TestMatrix}, with both varying loading amplitudes and different phase angles. Effects of the loading proportionality is an additional issue to be clarified experimentally.

%The mechanical strain component ($\varepsilon_{m}$) resulting when the free expansion thermal strain component ($\varepsilon_{th}$) is subtracted from the total strain ($\varepsilon_{t}$). In order to account for the thermal expansion during the tests, each specimen was heated by the induction heating device to the intended thermal cycle of the experiment under the  stress free condition before TMF tests. Under this condition the specimen can expand freely and the thermal expansion was measured directly. Figure \ref{Fig:plot_elastic_by_temperature_in718} shows variations of elasticity modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio as functions of temperature. The curves are independent of mechanical loading.

The mechanical strain ($\varepsilon_{m}$) is computed when the free expansion thermal strain ($\varepsilon_{th}$) is subtracted from the total strain ($\varepsilon_{t}$). The thermal strain was obtained by measuring the free expansion (i.e. measuring the strain under the zero load conditon) of the specimen throughout the duration of the intended temperature cycle. The strain tests were started after several thermal cycles (i.e. in the condition with zero force) in order to ensure the stability of temperature along the gauge section.
The criterion for failure is corresponding to the decrease of 25\% from the stabilized peak load. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to observe the morphology of fracture in order to characterize the damage mechanism under different thermomechanical loading conditions.

\section{Experimental results}

\subsection{Isothermal fatigue tests}
The results of a uniaxial isothermal test is analyzed firstly in order to identify primary material properties. Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_half_life_cycle} shows the obtained cyclic stress-strain curves, the values of stress and strain have been determined from the half life cycles. In comparision with the monotonic loading case, the stress-strain relationship for both monotonic and cyclic loadings is described by the known Ramberg-Osgood model, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_monotonic_cyclic_osgood}. It confirms that the strain hardening can be expressed in the power-law function fairly well. The material demonstrates significant cyclic softening, of which the monotonic stress-strain curve can be expressed by the conventional Ramberg-Osgood model, as
\begin{equation}
{\varepsilon } = \frac{{\sigma }}{{E}} + {\left( {\frac{{\sigma }}{{K}}} \right)^{1/n}},
\end{equation}
for the monotonic loading, where $K$ is the material plastic offset and $n$ is the monotonic strain hardening exponent.
The cyclic stress-strain relationship is assumed to be in the form of the Ramberg-Osgood model, as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\Delta \varepsilon }}{2} = \frac{{\Delta \sigma }}{{2E}} + {\left( {\frac{{\Delta \sigma }}{{2K'}}} \right)^{1/n'}},
\end{equation}
where $K'$ is the cyclic strength coefficient and $n'$ is the cyclic strain hardening exponent.
%Comparison between the present experiments and Ramberg-Osgood model is illustrated in Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_half_life_cycle}. The experimental loops are taken from $N_f/2$th cycles. More detailed discussions about cyclic plasticity for the Inconel718 are referred a separate publication by the authors \cite{Sun2017}.

Fig. \ref{Fig:Baseline} shows the comparison of experimental results by Kim \cite{kim1988elevated} and Nelson \cite{nelson1992creep}, Mohabia \cite{Mahobia2014} as well as ours. Partially significant difference is observed among the three series of testing, which may be induced by different material providers. Heat treatments and processing of all the three series of specimens are similar. From this observation one may expect obvious deviations in fatigue performance for the nominal same superalloy Inconel 718. 

The Manson-Coffin model is popular in engineering fatigue life assessment, in which the applied strain amplitude $\Delta \varepsilon/2$ is decomposed in elastic strain amplitude ($\Delta \varepsilon_e/2$) and plastic strain amplitude ($\Delta \varepsilon_p/2$). The fatigue life, in terms of number of reversals to failure ($2N_f$), is determined from
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\Delta \varepsilon }}{2} = \frac{{\Delta {\varepsilon _e}}}{2} + \frac{{\Delta {\varepsilon _p}}}{2} = \frac{{{{\sigma '}_f}}}{E}{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)^b} + {\varepsilon '_f}{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)^c},
\label{Equ:CoffinManson}
\end{equation}
where ${{{\sigma '}_f}}$ is the fatigue strength coefficient, $b$ is the fatigue strength exponent, ${{{\varepsilon '}_f}}$ is the fatigue ductility coefficient and $c$ is the fatigue ductility exponent. The model parameters can be determined from uniaxial fatigue data in combining with the Ramberg-Osgood model. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:MechanicalProperties} for all three series of experiments.

\subsection{Thermomechanical fatigue tests}

Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_fatigue_life} shows the lifetimes of thermomechanical fatigue tests under different loading conditions. The data are plotted as Mises equivalent strain amplitude $\Delta\varepsilon_{eq}/2$ versus number of cycles to failure $N_f$. The black solid line in the figure is the Coffin-Masson curve of 650$^\circ$C isothermal fatigue. It can be seen that the lifetimes under uniaxial thermomechanical in-phase and out-of-phase loadings and under multi-axial thermomechanical in-phase loadings are shorter than under isothermal loadings at the same equivalent strain amplitude.
In contrast, the lifetimes under uniaxial thermomechanical 90$^\circ$ phase loadings and proportional thermomechanical in-phase loadings are longer than under isothermal loadings.

For uniaxial thermomechanical fatigue tests, the mechanical strain amplitude vs. lifetime curves under the in-phase and out-of-phase loading conditons intersect with each other. The position of the crossover point is about 0.6\% of the mechanical strain amplitude.
At the mechanical strain amplitude bigger than 0.6\%, the in-phase thermomechanical fatigue tends to have a lower fatigue lifetime, oppositely, the in-phase thermomechanical fatigue lifetimes are longer than the out-of-phase at the mechanical strain amplitude smaller than 0.6\%.

\end{figure}

Fatigue tests with three different phase angles of the thermal loading and mechanical loading should give a systematical overview about the thermomechanical behavior of the material. Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_TCTMF} illustrates the evolution of the peak, valley and mean stresses for TC-IP, TC-OP and TC-90 loading tests. As expected, under strain-controlled uniaxial cyclic loading with mean mechanical strain, all fatigue tests show the cyclic softening behavior as well as the hysteresis loops reach a stable state with increasing number of cycles. The decreases of mean stresses were observed during the TC-IP loading tests, whereas for TC-OP loading the opposite is the case. Furthermore, due to the symmetry of temperature in the TC-90 loading (i.e. the temperatures are the same at maximum and minimum axial strain), the mean axial stress is constant during the entire life-cycle process.

As shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_PROTMF}, the experimental results of the PRO-IP loading tests show the similar cyclic softening behavior of the uniaxial TC-IP tests and the shear stress response is consistent with the axial stress response. In Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_PROTMF}(b) and (c), a decrease of mean stress was present in both axial and hoop directions.


Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_NPRTMF} shows the experimental results of NPR-IP loading tests. Unlike the results of PRO-IP loading tests, for equivalent strain amplitudes $\geqslant$0.8\%, cyclic hardening was present in the first three cycles in both axial and torsional directions. Afterwards, continuous cyclic softening follows for the major part of the fatigue life. Furthermore, compared to the PRO-IP data, both axial and shear stress amplitudes due to the same equivalent strain amplitudes are higher than the case of PRO-IP loading tests, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_NPRTMF}(b) and (c). Consequently, it was concluded that the additional non-proportional hardening occured in the mechanical non-proportional loading condition. In Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_exp_NPRTMF}(c), unlike the case of axial stress, the changes of mean value of shear stress under NPR-IP loading are tiny.

% And the softening behavior is observed much more at higher temperature than lower temperature.


% Fig. \ref{Fig:plot_monotonic_cyclic_osgood} shows the Mises equivalent strain amplitude vs. number of cycles to failure under four loading conditions: uniaxial in phase IP TMF, uniaxial out of phase OP TMF, proportional axial-torsional IP TMF and non-proportional axial torsional (diamond path) IP TMF.

% Firstly, we consider the in phase IP and out of phase OP effect under uniaxial tests. The out of phase OP cycles resulted in lives that are significantly longer than the in phase IP tests at the equivalent strain amplitude 1\%. As the strain amplitude decrease, the deviations of fatigue life $N_f$  becomes smaller.
% Secondly, we consider the multiaxial effect on the fatigue life. Because the temperature cycles of all the IF TMF tests from 300$^\circ$C to 650$^\circ$C remain the same. It was observed previously that the fatigue life of the multiaxial diamond path in phase IP TMF tests is shorter than the uniaxial in phase IP TMF tests. But the fatigue life of the proportional load path IP TMF tests is longer than the uniaxial IP TMF tests. This phenomenon was suggested to be related to the number of equivalent plastic strain of the two different strain paths.

\subsection{Fractography under different loadings conditions}
In Fig. \ref{Fig:crack_initiation}, for both isothermal and thermomechanical loadings, crack initiation and subsequent failure has been identified as being initiated at the outer surface of the specimen.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations reveal that the dominant fracture mechanism is changing with the phase angle of the thermal loading and mechanical loading, $\theta_{T-\varepsilon}$, as well as the mechanical loading path. Fig. \ref{Fig:crack_propagation}(a), (b) and (d) shows that intergranular fracture is more evident under in phase thermomechanical loading tests. However, Fig. \ref{Fig:crack_propagation}(c) shows that transgranular fracture plays a dominant role under out of phase thermomechanical loading tests. Consequently, it can be concluded that the intergranular fracture occurs mainly when high tensile stress and high temperature act simultaneously. However, under out of phase thermomechanical loadings, no visible morphology of grain boundaries is observed and the fatigue striations are very evident, which means that the creep damage can be ignored in such two loading conditions.

\section{ Thermomechanical Fatigue Assessment}

\subsection{Brown-Miller Model}
Based on the critical plane concepts \cite{Brown2006}, Wang and Brown \cite{Wang1993} proposed that the Kandil, Brown and Miller fatigue parameter \cite{Kandil1982} can be reformulated as the equivalent shear strain amplitude:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\Delta \hat \gamma }}{2} = \frac{{\Delta {\gamma _{max}}}}{2} + S\Delta {\varepsilon _n},
\label{Equ:ShearStrainBM}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{{\Delta \hat \gamma }}{2}$ is the equivalent shear strain range, $\Delta {\varepsilon _n}$ represents the normal strain excursion on the on the plane with the maximum strain range $\Delta {\gamma _{max}}$. The material dependent parameter S represents the influence of the normal strain on the crack propagation.
The fatigue endurance is suggested as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\Delta \hat \gamma }}{2} = A\frac{{{{\sigma '}_f}}}{E}{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)^b} + B{{\varepsilon '}_f}{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)^c},
\end{equation}
with
\[A = 1 + {\nu _e} + \left( {1 - {\nu _e}} \right)S,\]
and
\[B = 1 + {\nu _p} + \left( {1 - {\nu _p}} \right)S.\]
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering{\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{NF-NP-TMF-BM.pdf}}
\caption{Brown-Miller Model.}
\label{Fig:NF-NP-TMF-BM}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fatemi-Socie Model}
Based on the work of Brown and Miller, Fatemi and Socie \cite{Fatemi1988} proposed that the normal strain term in Equation (\ref{Equ:ShearStrainBM}) should be replaced by the normal stress.
The equivalent shear strain amplitude is developed as:
%\begin{equation}
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\Delta \hat \gamma }}{2} = \frac{{\Delta {\gamma _{\max }}}}{2}\left( {1 + k\frac{{{\sigma _{n,max}}}}{{{\sigma _y}}}} \right),
\end{equation}
where
$\sigma _{n,max}$ is the maximum normal stress on the critical plane suffering the maximum strain range $\Delta {\gamma _{max}}$, $k$ is a material parameter, the sensitivity of the material to normal stress is reflected in the ratio $k/\sigma_y$.
They developed a damaging model oriented on the shear-based damage initiation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\Delta \hat \gamma }}{2} = \frac{{{{\tau '}_f}}}{G}{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)^{{b_0}}} + {{\gamma '}_f}{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)^{{c_0}}}.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, McClaflin and Fatemi \cite{McClaflin2004} proposed that the sensitivity parameter $k$ is varied with fatigue life and can be expressed by tension and torsion data, as
\begin{equation}
k =  \frac{{k_0 {\sigma _y}}}{{{{\sigma '}_f}{{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)}^b}}}
\end{equation}
with
\[
k_0 =  {\frac{{\frac{{{{\tau '}_f}}}{G}{{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)}^{{b_0}}} + {{\gamma '}_f}{{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)}^{{c_0}}}}}{{\left( {1 + {\nu _e}} \right)\frac{{{{\sigma '}_f}}}{E}{{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)}^b} + \left( {1 + {\nu _p}} \right){{\varepsilon '}_f}{{\left( {2{N_f}} \right)}^c}}} - 1} .
\]

%where the equivalent shear strain on the critical plane was based on a combination of the maximum shear strain amplitude $\Delta \gamma$ and maximum normal stress $\sigma _{n,max}$ during the cycle. The shear strain was used as the variable decisive for the rain-flow decomposition.
%The criterion used to be based on the MSSR maximization.

between calculated Ncal and experimental Nexp fatigue lives has been made by means of two statistical parameters.
The first of them is a mean dispersion of fatigue life}

\[{T_N} = {10^{\bar E}}\]

where $\bar E$is given by:

\[\bar E = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\log \left( {\frac{{{N_{\exp ,i}}}}{{{N_{cal,i}}}}} \right)} \]
where n is a number of the compared results. The second parameter is a life prediction mean-squared error

\[{T_{RMS}} = {10^{{E_{RMS}}}}\]
where $E_{RMS}$ is given by:
\[{E_{RMS}} = \sqrt {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{{\log }^2}\left( {\frac{{{N_{\exp ,i}}}}{{{N_{cal,i}}}}} \right)} } \]

\marked{
$T_N$ equals 1 when mean experimental and calculated fatigue lives are equal; more than 1 when the experimental life values are higher than the calculated ones; lower than 1 when the experimental life values are lower than the calculated ones. The $T_N$ quantity is insensitive to the dispersion of life. It can assume the same value for the results with low and high statistical dispersion. Quantity $T_{RMS}$ is a measure of statistical dispersion. It assumes the value equal 1 when the mean and the statistical dispersion of experimental and computational life are identical. It is higher than 1 in other cases. $T_{RMS}$ does not provide any information on whether the computational life is higher or lower than the experimental one.}

\section{Conlusions}

This paper has described the experimental facility of non-proportional thermomechanical fatigue tests. The machine had to be carefully calibrated from its original design to improve the thermal gradient and ensure the control stability of the axial-torsional extensometers. The Nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 was investigated experimentally and computationally under 650$^\circ$C isothermal and 300$^\circ$C to 650$^\circ$C thermomechanical loading conditions with proportional and non-proportional mechanical strain paths. The main conclusions are as follows:

% A summary of the important mechanical test results is:

The TC-OP tests have a longer lifetime than the TC-IP tests within the Mises equivalent mechanical strain amplitude range from 0.6\% to 1\%.

TMF lifetimes are strongly influenced by the strain path. At the same equivalent mechanical strain amplitude and the same in phase temperature conditions, the NPR-IP tests have a shorter lifetime than the lifetime of TC-IP tests. However, the PRO-IP tests have the longest lifetime.

MasonFatigue parameters are determined on the isothermal fatigue tests.
The life predictions from the known fatigue models are unsatisfactory. The plots contains generally large scatterings, which implies improper fatigue variables in the models.
A TMF life prediction model has to consider influences from varying temperature as well as the non-proportional loads. The TMF life prediction is still an open issue.
